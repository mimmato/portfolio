## Node.js + Express API (branch)

This branch holds all information related to the node.js with Express API that I am writing. The idea is to have a simple API written in JavaScript with several endpoints that can be used for testing. 
NOTE that bugs are expected as that is the point of this entire project. 

### REQUIREMENTS:

- node.js (v20.12.2 or higher)
- nvm (0.39.7 Ð¾r higher)
- Express (4.19.2)   
- curl 
- MySQL (8.0.36)
- JavaScript (12.22.9)

### INSTALLATION:
